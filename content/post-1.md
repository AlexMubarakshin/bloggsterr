So, hi! I'am Alex. ✌️

I'am Front-end Tech lead at <a href="https://citronium.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Citronium LLC</a>.

I began my way in 2014 with programming on C++. In 2015, I got a job and programmed in swift, and then I found 'React Native' for myself. I look at it and say: «Wow! I can create mobile applications on both platforms with one code, cool!». After that, I create 3 or 5 demo applications and start looking at the front-end developing and framework `React`.

On React, I developed a SPA for one authentication provider service and started mentoring junior developers.

In 2017, due to the specifics of my employer, I had to start learning Blockchain and DevOps. I learned the basics of blockchain, developed two DApps and worked with Docker and Bash scripts... Many Bash scripts 😓...

After one year of such work, I began to feel that I was beginning to burn out. I wanted to change something and this “something” was my place of work.

I started looking at vacancies in other companies and realized that during this time while I was working with DevOps, I began to lose front-end skills. My journey to Front-end began again. In one month, I had to regain my skills, working on pet projects and taking courses after a working day. 🤯

When I felt that I was ready, I accepted the offer of the local company. At a new job, I created a microservice for sales automation. In parallel, I developed several mobile applications for React Native and one on Ionic Angular💩.

In this company, I met like-minded Dmitry. He, like me, loves programming and for him it's not just a job. We did cool things with him every day. We play with AI, IOT and many other cool hipster stuff.

But very soon, the company’s business went downhill, the management began to make the wrong decisions and I left the company with several developers and PM. 📉

I was about to leave for another city when suddenly a local company made me an offer, which I did not immediately agree with. But after several attempts on their part, I agreed and ended up at «Citronium». After one month, Dmitry also came to «Citronium».

Now I am creating front-end applications with React and mobile applications on React Native. I also mentor front-end developers.
