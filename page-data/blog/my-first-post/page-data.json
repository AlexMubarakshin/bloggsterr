I'am Alex. ✌️</p>\n<p>I'am Front-end Tech lead at <a href=\"https://citronium.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Citronium LLC</a>.</p>\n<p>I began my way in 2014 with programming on C++. In 2015, I got a job and programmed in swift, and then I found 'React Native' for myself. I look at it and say: «Wow! I can create mobile applications on both platforms with one code, cool!». After that, I create 3 or 5 demo applications and start looking at the front-end developing and framework <code>React</code>.</p>\n<p>On React, I developed a SPA for one authentication provider service and started mentoring junior developers.</p>\n<p>In 2017, due to the specifics of my employer, I had to start learning Blockchain and DevOps. I learned the basics of blockchain, developed two DApps and worked with Docker and Bash scripts... Many Bash scripts 😓...</p>\n<p>After one year of such work, I began to feel that I was beginning to burn out. I wanted to change something and this “something” was my place of work.</p>\n<p>I started looking at vacancies in other companies and realized that during this time while I was working with DevOps, I began to lose front-end skills. My journey to Front-end began again. In one month, I had to regain my skills, working on pet projects and taking courses after a working day. 🤯</p>\n<p>When I felt that I was ready, I accepted the offer of the local company. At a new job, I created a microservice for sales automation. In parallel, I developed several mobile applications for React Native and one on Ionic Angular💩.</p>\n<p>In this company, I met like-minded Dmitry. He, like me, loves programming and for him it's not just a job. We did cool things with him every day. We play with AI, IOT and many other cool hipster stuff.</p>\n<p>But very soon, the company’s business went downhill, the management began to make the wrong decisions and I left the company with several developers and PM. 📉</p>\n<p>I was about to leave for another city when suddenly a local company made me an offer, which I did not immediately agree with. But after several attempts on their part, I agreed and ended up at «Citronium». After one month, Dmitry also came to «Citronium».</p>\n<p>Now I am creating front-end applications with React and mobile applications on React Native. I also mentor front-end developers.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 10, 2019","path":"/blog/my-first-post","title":"Hello world ✌️"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
